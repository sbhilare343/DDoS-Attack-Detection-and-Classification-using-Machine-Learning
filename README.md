# DDoS Attack Detection and Mitigation Using Machine Learning

This project implements a Machine Learning-based system for detecting and mitigating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments. It combines Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for traffic pattern understanding and Random Forest for high-accuracy classification of attack traffic.

## üìå Features

- Real-time traffic monitoring and anomaly detection
- Adaptive mitigation using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN)
